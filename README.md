# IndexFast

**Stop publishing invisible pages.**

IndexFast is an indexing health, sitemap monitoring, IndexNow automation, and Google visibility diagnostics platform for fast-growing websites.

It helps pSEO builders, SEO agencies, directories, SaaS blogs, marketplaces, ecommerce stores, and AI-generated websites find pages that search engines are ignoring.

IndexFast does **not** promise fake “instant Google indexing.”  
It focuses on safe, transparent workflows:

- sitemap monitoring
- indexability checks
- Google Search Console visibility workflows
- IndexNow/Bing discovery
- deindexing alerts
- technical SEO diagnostics
- agency-ready reports

---

## What IndexFast Does

IndexFast helps website owners answer one simple question:

> Are my pages actually visible to search engines?

Most websites keep publishing pages without knowing:

- which URLs are indexed
- which URLs are blocked
- which URLs have `noindex`
- which URLs are missing from the sitemap
- which URLs have canonical issues
- which URLs dropped from Google
- which pages were discovered but not indexed
- which pages are technically indexable but still invisible

IndexFast turns indexing into a dashboard, not guesswork.
